Categories

This section describes the concepts of categories.

Overview
========

Categories are used to structure :doc:`products <products>`.

Every category can have either one or no parent category. In this way the
category tree is built, which serves as the essential navigation of the shop. If
a category has no parent it's a top level category.

Every category can have an arbitrary amount of products and sub categories. What
is displayed depends on the selected template and entered format informations
like amount of columns and rows of displayed products.

Each category can have several assigned :doc:`portlets <portlets>`. By default
the portlets are inherited from the parent category or from the shop preferences
(for top level categories). However, this can be blocked per :term:`slot`.

In addition a :doc:`static block <static_blocks>` can be assigned to a category,
which is displayed on top of the category page.
